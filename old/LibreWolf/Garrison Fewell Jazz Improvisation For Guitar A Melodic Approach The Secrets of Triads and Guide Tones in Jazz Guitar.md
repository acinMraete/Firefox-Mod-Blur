## What are triads and melodic extensions?
 
A triad is a three-note chord that consists of a root, a third, and a fifth. For example, a C major triad is made up of the notes C, E, and G. Triads can be classified into four types: major, minor, diminished, and augmented. Each type has a different sound and function in harmony.
 
A melodic extension is a note that is added to a triad to create a more complex and colorful sound. For example, adding a D to a C major triad creates a C major 9th sound. Melodic extensions can be derived from scales or modes that fit the underlying chord or key. For example, over a C major chord, you can use extensions from the C major scale, the C lydian mode, or the C pentatonic scale.
