The book is widely regarded as a masterpiece of scholarship and a valuable source of information on Islamic architecture in India. It is written in a clear and engaging style, with a balance of historical facts and aesthetic analysis. It also reflects the author's deep appreciation and admiration for the artistic achievements of the Muslim builders and architects in India. The book is a must-read for anyone interested in the history and culture of India, as well as the art and architecture of Islam.
  
One of the most remarkable features of Islamic architecture in India is its diversity and adaptability. The Muslim builders and architects were not only influenced by the existing traditions and styles of India, but also by the various regions and cultures they came from or encountered. As a result, Islamic architecture in India developed a rich and varied expression, reflecting the different historical, geographical, political, and religious contexts of its creation.
 
Another notable aspect of Islamic architecture in India is its synthesis and harmony with the indigenous architecture of India. The Muslim builders and architects did not impose their own style or ideology on the Indian landscape, but rather respected and integrated the local elements and motifs into their own designs. They also used the local materials and techniques available to them, such as stone, brick, plaster, wood, marble, tile, and inlay. Thus, Islamic architecture in India became a unique and original blend of the Islamic and Indian artistic traditions.
 
A third important characteristic of Islamic architecture in India is its functional and practical nature. The Muslim builders and architects were not only concerned with the aesthetic and symbolic aspects of their buildings, but also with their utility and durability. They designed their buildings to suit the needs and purposes of their patrons and users, such as rulers, nobles, merchants, scholars, pilgrims, or worshippers. They also considered the environmental and climatic factors of their sites, such as light, ventilation, drainage, insulation, and protection. Thus, Islamic architecture in India became a responsive and efficient form of architecture.
