Larry Stylinson is one of the most popular and controversial ships in the music industry. Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson met in 2010 when they auditioned for The X Factor UK as solo artists. They were put together with three other contestants, Niall Horan, Liam Payne, and Zayn Malik, to form the boy band One Direction. The group became a global sensation and sold millions of albums and tickets.
 
From the beginning, fans noticed the close friendship and affection between Harry and Louis. They gave each other nicknames, such as Hazza and Lou, and often shared jokes, compliments, and physical contact. They also had matching tattoos, such as a ship and a compass, a butterfly and a moth, and a heart and an arrow. Some fans speculated that they were more than friends and started to ship them as Larry Stylinson.
 
However, not everyone was supportive of Larry Stylinson. Some people denied their existence and accused fans of being delusional or disrespectful. Some media outlets mocked or ridiculed their relationship and spread rumors or lies about them. Some management teams and record labels allegedly tried to hide or suppress their feelings and forced them to date other people or act more masculine. Harry and Louis themselves became more distant and reserved in public and rarely addressed the topic of Larry Stylinson.
 
Despite the challenges and obstacles, Larry Stylinson fans never gave up on their ship. They continued to look for clues and evidence that Harry and Louis were still in love and secretly communicating with each other. They also created fan art, fan fiction, fan videos, and fan projects to celebrate and support their relationship. They hoped that one day Harry and Louis would be free to be themselves and be happy together.
