# What is the IATA Airport Handling Manual and Why You Need It
  
The IATA Airport Handling Manual (AHM) is a comprehensive guide to the policies and standards that support safe and efficient ground operations at airports. It covers all aspects of passenger, baggage, cargo, mail, aircraft handling and loading, load control, aircraft movement control, ground handling agreements, ground support equipment specifications, environmental specifications and ground operations training.
  
If you are involved in any of these areas of airport operations, you need the AHM to ensure compliance with international regulations and best practices. The AHM is updated annually to reflect the latest changes and developments in the industry. It also includes the only industry-recognized contract template, the Standard Ground Handling Agreement (SGHA) and the suggested template for Service Level Agreement (SLA).
