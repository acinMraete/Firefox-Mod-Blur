# How to Generate SSH Keys for vRealize Log Insight Appliance
 
vRealize Log Insight is a powerful log analytics and management solution that helps you troubleshoot and monitor your VMware environment. One of the features of vRealize Log Insight is the ability to access the appliance via SSH using key-based authentication. This can provide a more secure and convenient way to connect to the appliance without using passwords.
 
In this article, we will show you how to generate SSH keys for vRealize Log Insight appliance and configure them on the primary node and the other nodes in the cluster. We will also show you how to update the internal certificate of vRealize Log Insight, which is set to expire on April 30th 2023.

## Generate SSH Keys
 
The first step is to generate a public and private SSH key pair on the machine that you want to use to connect to vRealize Log Insight appliance. You can use any SSH client or tool that supports key generation, such as PuTTYgen or ssh-keygen. For this example, we will use ssh-keygen on a Linux machine.
 
To generate SSH keys using ssh-keygen, run the following command:

    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

This will create a 4096-bit RSA key pair with your email as a comment. You will be prompted to enter a file name and a passphrase for your keys. You can choose any file name you want, but we recommend using something like vrli\_key for clarity. You can also choose to leave the passphrase empty if you don't want to enter it every time you connect to vRealize Log Insight.
 
After running the command, you should see something like this:

    Generating public/private rsa key pair.
    Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa): vrli_key
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
    Enter same passphrase again:
    Your identification has been saved in vrli_key.
    Your public key has been saved in vrli_key.pub.
    The key fingerprint is:
    SHA256:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx your_email@example.com
    The key's randomart image is:
    +---[RSA 4096]----+
    |                 |
    |                 |
    |                 |
    |                 |
    |                 |
    |                 |
    |                 |
    |                 |
    +----[SHA256]-----+

You should now have two files in your .ssh directory: vrli\_key and vrli\_key.pub. The vrli\_key file is your private key and should be kept secret and secure. The vrli\_key.pub file is your public key and can be shared with vRealize Log Insight appliance.
 
## Configure SSH Key on Primary Node
 
The next step is to configure your public key on the primary node of vRealize Log Insight cluster. To do this, you need to log into the primary node as root via SSH or console, pressing ALT+F1 in a console to log in. You can use the default password vmware if you haven't changed it.
 
Once you are logged in as root, open the /root/.ssh/authorized\_keys file in a text editor, such as vi or nano. Paste your public key (the contents of vrli\_key.pub file) at the end of the file, then save and close it.

To verify that your public key has been added correctly, run the following command:

    cat /root/.ssh/authorized_keys

You should see something like this:

    ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAACAQCxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx your_email@example.com

## Configure SSH Key on Other Nodes
 
The final step is to repeat the same process on all other nodes in vRealize Log Insight cluster. You can use the same public key for all nodes, or generate different keys for each node if you prefer. Just make sure you add the corresponding public keys to each node's /root/.ssh/authorized\_keys file.
