To create a new database, you need to go to the File menu and select New Database. You will be asked to name your database and choose a location for it. You can also choose a template for your database that will pre-configure some settings and metadata fields for you. For example, if you choose the Sound Effects template, your database will have fields such as Category, Subcategory, Description, Keywords, etc.
 
After creating a new database, you need to import your audio files into it. You can do this by dragging and dropping files or folders from Finder into Soundminer Pro's main window. You can also use the Import menu or the Import button on the toolbar to browse for files or folders on your computer or on a network drive. You can import files in various formats such as WAV, AIFF, MP3, OGG, FLAC, etc. Soundminer Pro will automatically scan and index your files and extract their metadata such as name, duration, sample rate, bit depth, channels, etc.
 
Once you have imported your files into your database, you can organize them into categories and subcategories using the Category Editor. The Category Editor is a tool that allows you to create a hierarchical structure for your files based on their metadata or other criteria. For example, you can create a category for Animals and subcategories for Birds, Dogs, Cats, etc. You can also create custom fields and values for your files using the Field Editor. The Field Editor is a tool that allows you to add or edit metadata fields and values for your files such as Description, Keywords, Author, etc.
 
## How to Search and Audition Your Audio Files
 
One of the main features of Soundminer Pro is its powerful search engine that allows you to find any audio file in your database quickly and easily. You can search for files by typing keywords or phrases in the Search box or by using advanced filters and operators such as AND, OR, NOT, etc. You can also use wildcards (\*) and modifiers (+,-) to refine your search results. For example, you can search for dog\* to find all files that start with dog such as dog bark, dog growl, dog whimper, etc. You can also search for +dog -bark to find all files that contain dog but not bark such as dog growl, dog whimper, dog snore, etc.
 
As you type in the Search box or use filters and operators, Soundminer Pro will display matching files in the Results List below. The Results List shows various information about each file such as name, duration
