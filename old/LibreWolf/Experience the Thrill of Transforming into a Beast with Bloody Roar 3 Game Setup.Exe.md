# Bloody Roar 3: A Fighting Game with a Twist
 
Bloody Roar 3 is a 2000 fighting arcade video game developed by Eighting and Hudson Soft. It is the first of the Bloody Roar series to appear on the Sony PlayStation 2. The game features 12 characters, each with their own unique beast form that grants them enhanced abilities and special attacks. The game also has a variety of modes, such as Arcade, Versus, Survival, Time Attack, and Practice.
 
The main feature of Bloody Roar 3 is the ability to transform into beasts, which is involved in all of the Bloody Roar games. Each character has a beast gauge that fills up as they fight. When the gauge is full, the character can transform into their beast form by pressing a button. The beast form gives the character increased speed, strength, defense, and access to new moves. However, the beast gauge will gradually deplete while in beast form, and when it runs out, the character will revert to their human form. The player can also perform a Beast Drive, which is a powerful special attack that can only be used in beast form.

Bloody Roar 3 received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the graphics, gameplay, and beast mode, but criticized the lack of story, originality, and depth. The game was also compared unfavorably to other fighting games at the time, such as Tekken Tag Tournament and Dead or Alive 2. Despite the mixed reception, Bloody Roar 3 was a commercial success, selling over one million copies worldwide. The game was followed by two sequels: Bloody Roar 4 in 2003 and Bloody Roar: Primal Fury in 2002.
