# Physiological Control Systems: Analysis, Simulation, and Estimation by Michael Khoo
 
Physiological Control Systems is a textbook that provides an introduction to the principles and applications of control theory and mathematical modeling in physiological systems. The book covers topics such as static and dynamic analysis of linear and nonlinear systems, digital simulation, parameter estimation, time-varying systems, complex dynamics, and feedback regulation. The book also includes examples and exercises based on MATLAB and SIMULINK programs.

The book is intended for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in biomedical engineering, as well as researchers and practitioners who are interested in understanding and analyzing physiological processes using mathematical tools. The book is written by Michael C.K. Khoo, who is a Professor of Biomedical Engineering and Pediatrics at the University of Southern California. He is a fellow of the IEEE, Biomedical Engineering Society, the American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering, and the International Academy of Medical and Biological Engineering.
 
The book was first published in 2018 by Wiley-IEEE Press. It is the second edition of the book, which was originally published in 2000. The second edition has been updated and expanded to include new topics such as nonlinear analysis, complex dynamics, model identification, and estimation and control of time-varying systems. The book also features new examples and case studies from various physiological domains such as cardiovascular, respiratory, neural, endocrine, and metabolic systems.
 
The book has received positive reviews from experts in the field. For example, Dr. Thomas Heldt from MIT said that "Physiological Control Systems is an outstanding textbook that provides a comprehensive introduction to the analysis of physiological systems using control theory. It is a must-read for anyone interested in learning how to apply mathematical modeling and simulation techniques to understand and predict the behavior of complex biological systems." Dr. Mette Olufsen from North Carolina State University said that "This book is an excellent resource for students and researchers who want to learn about physiological control systems. It covers a wide range of topics from basic concepts to advanced methods in a clear and accessible way. It also includes many practical examples and exercises that illustrate the applications of control theory to real-world problems."
 
The book can be purchased online from various sources such as Wiley Online Books[^1^], Chegg[^2^], or Amazon. However, there is no official solutions manual for the book available online or offline. Some websites may claim to offer solutions manual for the book, but they are not verified or authorized by the author or publisher. Therefore, users should be cautious about downloading or using such materials as they may contain errors or viruses.
