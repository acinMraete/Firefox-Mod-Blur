[eptar] Reinforcement is a solution that allows civil engineers to work directly on the architectural BIM model in ArchiCAD and create reinforcement plans, cutting lists and detail drawings. It supports ArchiCAD versions 13 and above, including 16-18, and it is available in three languages: English, German and Hungarian.

In this article, we will show you how to use [eptar] Reinforcement for ArchiCAD 16-18 to create reinforcement plans for different structural elements, such as beams, columns, walls and stairs. We will also show you how to customize the settings, generate labels and lists, and export the results.
  
## How to Create Reinforcement Plans for Beams
  
To create reinforcement plans for beams, you need to follow these steps:
  
1. Select the beam tool from the toolbox and draw a beam element on the floor plan.
2. Select the [eptar] Reinforcement tool from the toolbox and click on the beam element.
3. In the settings dialog box, choose the type of reinforcement (main bars, stirrups or polygonal bars), the shape, size, spacing and offset of the bars, and the crowning options.
4. Click OK to apply the settings and generate the reinforcement bars.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for any other beams you want to reinforce.
6. Select the label tool from the toolbox and click on a beam element to create a label with the reinforcement information.
7. Select the list tool from the toolbox and click on an empty space on the floor plan to create a list with the cutting information of all the beams.

## How to Create Reinforcement Plans for Columns
  
To create reinforcement plans for columns, you need to follow these steps:

1. Select the column tool from the toolbox and draw a column element on the floor plan.
2. Select the [eptar] Reinforcement tool from the toolbox and click on the column element.
3. In the settings dialog box, choose the type of reinforcement (main bars or stirrups), the shape, size, spacing and offset of the bars, and the crowning options.
4. Click OK to apply the settings and generate the reinforcement bars.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for any other columns you want to reinforce.
6. Select the label tool from the toolbox and click on a column element to create a label with the reinforcement information.
7. Select the list tool from the toolbox and click on an empty space on the floor plan to create a list with the cutting information of all the columns.
